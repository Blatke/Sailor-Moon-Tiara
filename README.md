# Sailor Moon Tiara
A HS2/AIS head accessory.
## How to Use
Download the .zipmod file for the latest version on the [Release](https://github.com/Blatke/Sailor-Moon-Tiaras/releases) page, and drag and drop it into your **/mods/** folder or use KKManager to install it.

In Chara Maker Mode, go to the **Accessory** panel, and then the **Head** tab, search for "blake", "sailor moon" or "tiara" to find this accessory.

Add it to your chara, and it suggests changing its Base Position to "Forehead" so that it will be easy to place it in an accurate position.

It was rigged so that you can adjust its bones in Studio. Enable the adv.mode of HS2PE/AIPE, go to the Bone tab, search for "diamond", and you'll see the bones namely diamond.total, diamond.bottom, and diamond.top.

Select diamond.total, and scale it up. The whole jewelry on the front of the ring is enlarged. This bone affects diamond.bottom and diamond.top which are its children.

Diamond.bottom controls (and deforms) the golden base under the gemstone, but doesn't affect the gemstone.
